What is it?
===========

This module provides support for the [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://ens.domains). For this it uses several other ENS-related KEthereum modules modules (e.g. [EIP137](../eip137) to generate the NameHash or [ERC634](../erc634) to access text records).

How to use it?
==============

The only mandatory constructor parameter is the rpc that is used to connect to the Ethereum chain. By default the contract at 0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e on them main chain will be used. So make sure your RPC is on the same chain.

```kotlin
val ens = ENS(rpc)
```

If you want to use another contract you can pass it in like this:

```kotlin
val ens = ENS(rpc ,Address("0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e"))
```

to use the contract deployed on g√∂rli.

### Resolving addresses

You can then resolve data. E.g. to get the Ethereum address associated with some ens name you can do:

```kotlin
val address = ens.getAddress(ENSName("vitalik.eth"))
```

Be aware that ens domains do not need to end in ".eth" - the following will also resolve:

```kotlin
val address = ens.getAddress(ENSName("kevins.xyz"))
```

### Checking ENS-domains

If you want to find out if an ens name is a potential ENS domain (e.g. to prevent hitting your RPC with futile requests) you can use the following extension function:

```kotlin
val willBeTrue = ENSName("test.eth").isPotentialENSDomain()
val willBeFalse = ENSName("test.yo").isPotentialENSDomain()
```

### Getting text records

To get text records you can do:
```kotlin
val address = ens.getTextRecord(ENSName("ligi.ethereum.eth"), "key")
```
There are vanity methods for the keys "email", "url" ,"avatar", "description", "notice","keywords", "vnd.github", "vnd.peepeth", "vnd.twitter" that are listed in [EIP634](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-634). You should only use the `getTextRecord` methods for custom keys.

E.g. to get the github username for a name you can do:

```kotlin
val address = ens.getGithubUserName(ENSName("ligi.ethereum.eth"))
```

## Reverse lookup addresses

If you want to do a reverse lookup some address you can do:

```kotlin
val name = ens.reverseResolve(Address("d8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045"))```
